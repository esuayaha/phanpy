 * Creates an element that exactly matches an input pixel-for-pixel and automatically stays in sync with it. This
 * is a non-interactive overlay on to the input and can be used to affect the visual appearance of the input
 * without modifying its behavior. The clone element is hidden by default.
 *
 * This lower level API powers the `InputRange` but provides more advanced functionality including event updates.
 *
 * Emits `update` events whenever anything is recalculated: when the layout changes, when the user scrolls, when the
 * input is updated, etc. This event may be emitted more than once per change.
 *
 * @note There may be cases in which the clone cannot observe changes to the input and fails to automatically update.
 * For example, if the `value` property on the input is written to directly, no `input` event is emitted by the input
 * and the clone does not automatically update. In these cases, `forceUpdate` can be used to manually trigger an update.
